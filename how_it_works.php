	<div class="container">

		<p>This website is meant to be considered in conjunction with our physical mini-closet prototype (pictured above). As of now, our display allows users to visualize items they are neglecting by featuring light over each item in a color that corresponds with the number of days ago the item was last worn.</p>

		<p>Scanning an item to the RFID reader will increment the number of times the item was worn and reset the number of days ago it was last worn (setting the light color above the item to white, which signifies that it was worn within the past 10 days). Visualizing this data can aid users in easily recognizing the items they have neglected, which can prompt them to either use those items more or get rid of them so that they can be of use to someone else.</p>
